# DS-Journey
As an aspiring Data Scientist,
I have been trying to self learn from different online platforms to cross skill myself for the past two years.
But, I was lacking discipline.
I undertook this year long course in Scaler and it has helped me to get a schedule to work on.
And I thrive better when there is a deadline.
I'm going to log my activities on a daily basis.
Assignment solutions
Case studies
LeetCode/HackerRank/InterviewBit question answers
Lecture Notes
Interesting things that i picked up on the way.
